# Changelog

## 0.2.26-rc.1

### Fixed
- Launcher icon-pack changes now refresh immediately, including pinned-icon pack changes and resetting per-app icon overrides, without requiring `termux-reload-settings`.

## 0.2.25

### Added
- **Termux AI** — run LLMs locally, on-device, right inside the terminal. Two native backends, Google **LiteRT** and Alibaba's **MNN**, serve models over OpenAI- and Ollama-compatible APIs. Works on devices with a supported SoC and enough RAM (Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 or newer recommended). Quickest start: `pkg i -y aichat`.
- New **Valerie capsule** dock, with better AGSL glass blur, smoother dock physics, and refreshed animations and lighting.
- New app icon.

### Changed
- The optional one-script setup now installs **oh-my-posh** as the shell prompt.
- Dynamic terminal colors and app-name labels are now on by default.
- Reworked open-source attribution and license notices; replaced the fuzzy app-search library with an in-house ranking engine.

## 0.2.23

First release shipped in two editions: the **Termux edition** (`com.termux`, tag `v0.2.23`) compatible with the upstream Termux package ecosystem, and the **VAJ edition** (`io.vaj.tl`, tag `v0.2.23-vaj`) installable alongside official Termux with its own embedded aarch64 bootstrap and VAJ APT repository. See the README's Editions section.

### Added
- Exposed multimodal Gemma 4 (LiteRT) models as modality-scoped OpenAI ids that share one downloaded file: the canonical id loads text-only, `<id>-vision` loads text+image, and `<id>-audio` loads text+audio. This mirrors Google AI Edge Gallery's per-task loading and keeps each GPU load small enough to fit. Select the id from the shell; switching ids reloads the runtime scoped to that modality.
- TAI model import by Hugging Face repo URL with auto backend detection, per-model modality/capability configuration, and imported/downloaded models listed in Browse Catalog.
- LiteRT embedding runtime, LauncherCtl MCP documentation, and OpenAI Responses / Ollama client compatibility for the local model host.
- Per-key glass refraction, glyph glow feedback, dock-glass grain control, and an Apps & Access settings overhaul.

### Changed
- Updated MNN native libraries to 3.6.0 with a UTF-8 continuation-byte patch (fixes emoji/UTF-8 streaming crashes).
- Refined dock styling: glow tiers, capsule icon sizing, page indicator, popup, and wallpaper-mode dock style.

### Fixed
- Bound the isolated `:tai_runtime` process with `BIND_IMPORTANT` so a GPU model load inherits the launcher's foreground priority and is no longer SIGKILLed by Android's low-memory killer during OpenCL initialization (previously surfaced as a runtime "crash" loading large models such as Gemma 4 E4B on GPU).
- Fixed TAI generation streaming, vision autoload, completions on on-disk models, a TAI settings ANR, and restored dock page swipe, extra-keys text-input swipe, and icon contour/pack precedence.

## 0.2.22

### Added
- Added `launcherctl update-scripts` to refresh optional shell/tmux helper scripts without rerunning Getting Started.

### Changed
- Removed the redundant arbitrary `rish` wrapper; use `rish -c` directly for custom Shizuku shell commands and `launcherctl tty-doctor` for setup checks.

### Fixed
- Fixed tmux CPU/RAM helper behavior to prefer efficient `launcherctl resources` data, with a bounded `rish` fallback for plain Termux setups.
- Fixed Shizuku btop helper wrappers to preserve an explicit `RISH_BIN` path.

## 0.2.21

### Added
- Added launcher permission access settings and an accessibility lock prompt.
- Added a guided optional tmux and Shizuku btop setup helper.

### Fixed
- Fixed launch failure when Android denies access to the system wallpaper backdrop.

## 0.2.20

### Changed

## 0.2.14

### Changed
- Improved dock blur implementation and wallpaper sampling so the phone is not a hand warmer anymore.

- Exposed Material colors in `~/.termux/material-colors.sh` and `~/.termux/material-colors.properties` for shell integrations such as tmux status bars.
