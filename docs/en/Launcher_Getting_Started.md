# Getting Started

This page is the main setup guide for Termux Launcher. Start here, then use the smaller reference pages only when you need them:

- [LauncherCtl](LauncherCtl_API.md) for launching apps and reading launcher data from the shell.
- [Termux AI](Termux_AI.md) for the local on-device AI endpoint.
- [Developer docs](Developer_Docs.md) for advanced API, runtime, helper-script, and security details.

## 1. Install Termux Launcher

1. Download and install the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/PickleHik3/termux-launcher/releases).
2. Open the app normally once. This lets Termux finish its first-run bootstrap.
3. If you want to switch Termux from `pkg`/`apt` to `pacman`, do that before setting Termux Launcher as your Home app. That keeps fail-safe mode easy to reach. See the Termux wiki page for [switching package manager](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Switching_package_manager).
4. Set Termux Launcher as your Android Home app.

You can do that from Android settings, or from inside Termux Launcher:

```text
Long press Terminal -> More -> Apps Bar -> Set as home launcher
```

Termux Launcher cannot be installed beside the regular Termux app because both use the same package identity. If terminal drawing or input becomes slow after an update, run:

```sh
termux-reload-settings
```

## 2. Install Helpful Apps

Recommended:

- [Unexpected Keyboard](https://github.com/Julow/Unexpected-Keyboard), especially for terminal and tmux use. It is also available on [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=juloo.keyboard2).
- [Shizuku](https://github.com/rikkaapps/shizuku), only if you want optional lock-screen, Shizuku shell, or `btop` helper features.

If you use Termux add-ons, use the matching companion forks:

- [Termux:API](https://github.com/PickleHik3/termux-api/releases)
- [Termux:Styling](https://github.com/PickleHik3/termux-styling/releases)

Mixing differently signed Termux add-ons can cause shared UID or signing errors.

## 3. Learn the Launcher Surface

The terminal is the home screen. Launcher controls sit around the Termux session.

- **Apps row:** Long press an app icon to pin, move, or place it in a folder. Long press empty space in the apps row for list-based management.
- **A-Z row:** Swipe across the row to filter installed apps by letter. Swipe upward from a letter to launch an app from that group.
- **Terminal search:** Type the input split character before a query to search apps from terminal input. The default is `%`, so `%whatsapp` searches for WhatsApp.
- **Lock screen:** Double tapping the alphabet row can lock the phone if you configure a lock method in Apps Bar settings.

Most settings are under:

```text
Long press Terminal -> More
```

Useful places:

- **Appearance:** Terminal opacity, blur, dock size, compact dock spacing, monochrome icons, and Terminal Material colors.
- **Apps Bar:** Input split character, app ranking reset, Home launcher shortcut, and lock-screen behavior.
- **TAI / Termux AI:** Local model downloads, imports, runtime settings, API port, and API token.

Live wallpapers can disable dock blur. If you use two rows of Extra Keys, turn on compact dock spacing so the terminal has more room.

## 4. Use LauncherCtl From the Shell

`launcherctl` is installed by the app when the launcher session starts. It lets shell tools talk to the launcher.

Try:

```sh
launcherctl status
launcherctl apps
launcherctl launch whatsapp
```

Useful commands:

```sh
launcherctl resources
launcherctl media
launcherctl notifications
launcherctl restart
launcherctl update-scripts
launcherctl token rotate
```

Media and notification commands need Android notification listener access. For endpoint files, authentication, and scripting examples, see [LauncherCtl](LauncherCtl_API.md).

## 5. Optional Shell and tmux Setup

tmux is recommended if you want a persistent terminal workspace. My broader shell setup usually includes:

- fish
- oh-my-posh
- tmux
- eza
- zoxide
- btop through Shizuku `rish`

Install the common packages first if you want that style of setup:

```sh
pkg i -y tmux curl jq git fish oh-my-posh termux-api
```

Before running the setup, turn on Material colors if you want the tmux theme to follow your wallpaper:

```text
Long press Terminal -> More -> Appearance -> Terminal Material colors
```

The optional setup script can install the [termux-launcher-tmux](https://github.com/PickleHik3/termux-launcher-tmux) theme/plugin integration and the optional `btop` wrapper that runs through Shizuku `rish`:

```sh
curl -fsSL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PickleHik3/termux-launcher/main/docs/en/examples/setup-tmux-btop" -o ~/setup-tmux-btop
chmod 700 ~/setup-tmux-btop
~/setup-tmux-btop
```

The script asks what to install:

- **All:** tmux theme plus the optional Shizuku `btop` helper.
- **tmux only:** theme and status helpers only.
- **btop only:** only the Shizuku `btop` helper.

The tmux plugin includes an `Alt + e` keybind reference.

If you have already completed setup and later update the APK, refresh only the repo-owned helper scripts with:

```sh
launcherctl update-scripts
```

This keeps your tmux config intact.

You can create tmux key bindings to launch Android apps. This example makes `Alt + w` open WhatsApp:

```tmux
bind -n M-w run-shell 'tmux display-message "Opening WhatsApp"; launcherctl launch whatsapp >/dev/null 2>&1 || tmux display-message "Launch failed: WhatsApp"'
```

## 6. Optional Shizuku and rish Setup

You do not need Shizuku for normal launcher use. Set up Shizuku only if you want Shizuku-backed lock-screen behavior, a Shizuku shell, or the optional `btop-shizuku` and `mini-btop-shizuku` commands.

For `btop`, set up `rish` before choosing the `btop` option in the tmux setup script:

1. Install and start [Shizuku](https://github.com/rikkaapps/shizuku). The [official Shizuku setup guide](https://shizuku.rikka.app/guide/setup/) has the Android-side steps.
2. In the Shizuku app, open **Use Shizuku in terminal apps**.
3. Let Shizuku create `rish` and `rish_shizuku.dex`.
4. Copy both files into a Termux directory that is in your `$PATH`.

For example:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
```

If `~/.local/bin` is not already in your path, add this to your shell startup file:

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Then edit the bottom of `rish` and set:

```sh
RISH_APPLICATION_ID="com.termux"
```

Make `rish` executable and run it once:

```sh
chmod +x "$(command -v rish)"
rish
```

Grant the Shizuku permission prompt. After that, check the setup:

```sh
launcherctl tty-doctor
```

Now you can run `~/setup-tmux-btop` again and choose **All** or **btop only**.

## 7. Optional Extra Keys

Termux Launcher includes the regular Termux Extra Keys support and adds a convenient paste popup. Extra Keys are configured in:

```sh
~/.termux/termux.properties
```

After changing that file, reload settings:

```sh
termux-reload-settings
```

### Compact tmux Row

This one-row layout is the easiest default for tmux. It assumes the tmux setup above is installed and uses `CTRL b` as the tmux prefix.

```properties
extra-keys = [[ \
  {macro: "CTRL b F12", display: "♼"}, \
  {macro: "CTRL b h", display: "𝍣", popup: {macro: "CTRL b v", display: "𝍬"}}, \
  {macro: "CTRL b 1", display: "⓵"}, \
  {macro: "CTRL b 2", display: "⓶"}, \
  {macro: "CTRL b 3", display: "⓷"}, \
  {macro: "CTRL b [", display: "✎"}, \
  {key: KEYBOARD, popup: PASTE}, \
  {macro: "CTRL b", display: "㋡"} \
]]
```

### Two-Row tmux Layout

Use this if you want dedicated modifier keys and more tmux controls. Turn on compact dock spacing first.

```properties
extra-keys = [[ \
  {macro: "CTRL b h", display: "𝍣"}, \
  {macro: "CTRL b v", display: "𝍬"}, \
  {macro: "ALT LEFT", display: "⬸"}, \
  {macro: "CTRL b c", display: "+"}, \
  {macro: "ALT RIGHT", display: "⤑"}, \
  {macro: "CTRL b [", display: "✏"}, \
  {macro: "CTRL b z", display: "□"}, \
  {macro: "CTRL b x", display: "×", popup: {macro: "CTRL b k", display: "⊠"}} \
], [ \
  {key: ESC, display: "Esc", popup: {macro: "CTRL b F12", display: "⟲"}}, \
  {key: TAB, display: "TAB"}, \
  {key: SHIFT, display: "SHFT"}, \
  {key: CTRL, display: "CTRL"}, \
  {key: ALT, display: "ALT"}, \
  {key: LEFT, popup: DOWN}, \
  {key: RIGHT, popup: UP}, \
  {key: KEYBOARD, popup: PASTE} \
]]
```

## 8. Optional Termux AI

Termux AI, also called TAI, is a local model host built into Termux Launcher. It exposes an OpenAI-compatible localhost endpoint for tools such as `aichat`.

Start here:

```text
Long press Terminal -> More -> TAI / Termux AI
```

Then download or import a model and check the shell helper:

```sh
tai status
tai models
tai runtime
```

For model setup, OpenAI-compatible client configuration, and troubleshooting, see [Termux AI](Termux_AI.md).

## 9. Quick Troubleshooting

If terminal drawing, input, or colors feel stale:

```sh
termux-reload-settings
```

If the launcher bridge is not responding:

```sh
launcherctl status
launcherctl restart
```

If `launcherctl` is missing, restart Termux Launcher. The app installs the command when the launcher activity starts.

If Shizuku features do not work, confirm Shizuku is running, grant permission to Termux Launcher, and run:

```sh
launcherctl tty-doctor
```

If media or notification commands return empty data, grant notification listener access to Termux Launcher in Android settings.
